## Project description:

 Our group project aims to develop an innovative application that revolutionizes the way movie enthusiasts explore and access local movie showtimes. With the integration of prominent APIs such as OMDB and Serp, our application provides users with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to discover and enjoy local movies. The key feature of our application is the ability to display accurate and up-to-date movie showtimes for nearby theaters. By leveraging the OMDB API, we ensure that users have access to a vast database of movies, including information about genres, actors, directors, and more. This feature empowers moviegoers to easily find movies they are interested in and plan their entertainment accordingly. To enhance the movie selection process, our application incorporates the Rotten Tomatoes API, allowing users to view the critical and audience ratings of each movie. This integration enables users to make informed decisions about the movies they wish to watch, based on the aggregated reviews and ratings from trusted sources.
